            <b>rem</b> is relative to font-size of the root element	
                 1rem equals the font size of the html element (which for most browsers has a default value of 16px).<br><br>rem means Root EM.
                 It's built to provide some relief the em computational problem that many faced. It is a unit of typography equal to the root font-size . 
                 <br><br>An <b>EM</b> is a unit of typography, equal to the currently specified point-size
                <br><br> <b>Percentages </b>are commonly used for width and height of containers, divs and for sizing responsive images.</p>

            <p ><b>px</b> —is a unit of length which roughly corresponds to the width or height of a single dot that can be comfortably <br><br>seen by the human eye without strain, but is otherwise as small as possible.
            since 16px is the default size .when we add or make it 200px the font or the size will grow the <br><br>broswer will take 200px comparing it to the deafult size .if it is greater than 16px the font will increase.</p>

            <p >     <h3> new Features in css3</h3>
                <h4>1.Box Shadows</h4>
                It`s a new feature that allows a content slide beneath another area such as footer, to give an appearance as if it`s coming out or sinking into the website.<br><br> The process is pretty simple and there is no need for the developer to create a new image or make use of JavaScript plugin.
<br><br>
<h4>2. CSS3 Selectors</h4>
                Although CSS selectors were too present in the previous versions, but here they are more updated and improved. Using these selectors, choosing DOM elements on<br><br> the basis of there attributes is extremely easy. You don`t really need to specify classes and IDs for each and every element. <br><br>Instead, you can use these field elements to perform styling functions.
                <br><br>
            <h4>3. Font Additions</h4>
                Adding fonts is super easy in CSS 3, all you need to do is just upload the file to your server, link to the CSS file and add fonts as per your choice.
                <br><br>
            <h4>4. Rounded Corners</h4>
                The primary motive of rounded corners is spruce the overall look of a website, but to utilize it, a designer needs to struggle hard to write a plenty of code and<br><br> adjusting other specifications such as height, width, and positioning of multiple elements.
                
                CSS3 addresses all these issues by presenting a feature called border-radius.<br><br>The feature provides you all the rounded elements features without making you write a single line of code.
                <br><br>
            <h4>        5. Border Images</h4>
                Another cool feature of CSS 3 is the introduction of border images. The feature allows you to exchange a border with an image. <br><br>It helps you specify an image in place of a plain solid-colored border.
<br><br>
<h4>   6. Opacity Levels</h4>
                Earlier, designers had to either create a new image or make use of CSS filters. But in CSS3, you simply need to provide an input “opacity:0.5” to get the desirable effects.
                <br><br>
            <h4>7. Transform</h4>
                The function allows you to determine how big an area would become when hover.
<br><br>
<h4>   8. CSS3 Text Shadow</h4>
                The function allows you to add drop shadows to the text. In the previous version, the designers had to either use an image or a duplicate text element and then position it.
